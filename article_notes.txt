1. Undo

In the design tool, we would want an undo function. It is easy for the AI to
change something that we don't like

2. Prompt for permission - good idea on modify

3. Making a set of interfaces that work with with the GPT
E.G.
SetDocumentOutline
SetDocumentAbstract
AddDocumentSection(header, content)
didn't work well. Instead of SetDocumentOutline, it would
AddDocumentSection("outline")

Changed to accessing sections by namne

4. The GPT can handle IDs, but it makes the effort more complex
Need to ensure the GPT can get the right ids.
Better to use names and lookup DB entries based on the name

5. Different states allow
- a subset of functions to be included
- specific goals and instructions to be included (even more important)
